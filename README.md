# RustBookProjects
Projects from "The Rust Programming Language" / "THE Rust Book" / standard Rust Intro.




For Reference, using learning experiment version from Brown: [(Brown) Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)

For possibly more stable reference: [Rust Book: Guessing Game Tutorial](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

(Note: deleted original repository and remade after I realized that 
I was getting a lot of stuff in `**/target/...` directories of the various
micro-projects being git-synched.
With a parent `.git` above all the individual projects `cargo new` no longer 
generated not only a local `.git` folder, but also no a `.gitignore`file
and I hadn't created a `.gitignore` in the parent.  So just burned it all down
and restarted. ;)
