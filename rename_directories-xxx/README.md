Started project, was very useful, but now abandoning it
That seems the best use of time.
To do would have taking the nodes within the given directory and changing their
'-' <~~> '_' (and fixing the at least one example that didn't need to be changed -- the current dir)
Making sure not to change the directories along the path to the single level of nodes
(the current code example will change the whole thing: whoops!; it only prints what the change would be currently, however)

Honestly, it probably wouldn't be too difficult to finish the project -- but the orig. motivation
pulls me less strongly (directory style of my books-projects-rust directory)
And I feel like I've learned /" and gained a ton -- time to move forward with
either more rust (on documentation comments) or some serious Python changes
